# Module 05: Unit 4 - Deploy Azure Application Gateway

## Lab scenario 

In this lab, you use the Azure portal to create an application gateway. Then you test it to make sure it works correctly.

>**Note**: An **[interactive lab simulation](https://mslabs.cloudguides.com/guides/AZ-700%20Lab%20Simulation%20-%20Deploy%20Azure%20Application%20Gateway)** is available that allows you to click through this lab at your own pace. You may find slight differences between the interactive simulation and the hosted lab, but the core concepts and ideas being demonstrated are the same.

The application gateway directs application web traffic to specific resources in a backend pool. You assign listeners to ports, create rules, and add resources to a backend pool. For the sake of simplicity, this article uses a simple setup with a public front-end IP, a basic listener to host a single site on the application gateway, a basic request routing rule, and two virtual machines in the backend pool.

For Azure to communicate between the resources that you create, it needs a virtual network. You can either create a new virtual network or use an existing one. In this example, you'll create a new virtual network while you create the application gateway. Application Gateway instances are created in separate subnets. You create two subnets in this example: one for the application gateway, and another for the backend servers.

## Lab Objectives
In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:

+ Task 1: Create an application gateway
+ Task 2: Create virtual machines
+ Task 3: Add backend servers to backend pool
+ Task 4: Test the application gateway

## Estimated time: 25 minutes

## Task 4: Test the application gateway

Although IIS isn't required to create the application gateway, you installed it in this exercise to verify if Azure successfully created the application gateway.

### Use IIS to test the application gateway:

1. On the application gateway navigate to **Overview** page and find the public IP address. 

    ![Azure Portal search for application gateway](../media/l5u4-4.png)  

1. Copy the public IP address, and then paste it into the address bar of your browser to browse that IP address.

1. Check the response. A valid response verifies that the application gateway was successfully created and can successfully connect with the backend.

   ![Broswer - display BackendVM1 or BackendVM2 depending which backend server reponds to request.](../media/browse-to-backend1.png)

1. Refresh the browser multiple times and you should see connections to both BackendVM1 and BackendVM2.

   Congratulations! You have configured and tested an Azure Application Gateway.

## Extend your learning with Copilot

## Key takeaways

Congratulations on completing the lab. Here are the main takeaways for this lab. 
+ Azure Application Gateway is a web traffic (OSI layer 7) load balancer that enables you to manage traffic to your web applications.
+ Application Gateway can make routing decisions based on additional attributes of an HTTP request, for example URI path or host headers.
+ Use Application Gateway for application hosted in a single region and when you need URL based routing.
