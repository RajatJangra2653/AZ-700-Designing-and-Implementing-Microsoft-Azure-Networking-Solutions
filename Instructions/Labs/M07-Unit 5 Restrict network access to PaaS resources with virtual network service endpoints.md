# Module 07-Unit 5 Restrict network access to PaaS resources with virtual network service endpoints

## Lab scenario 
Virtual network service endpoints enable you to limit network access to some Azure service resources to a virtual network subnet. You can also remove internet access to the resources. Service endpoints provide direct connection from your virtual network to supported Azure services, allowing you to use your virtual network's private address space to access the Azure services. Traffic destined to Azure resources through service endpoints always stays on the Microsoft Azure backbone network.

**Note:** An **[interactive lab simulation](https://mslabs.cloudguides.com/guides/AZ-700%20Lab%20Simulation%20-%20Restrict%20network%20access%20to%20PaaS%20resources%20with%20virtual%20network%20service%20endpoints)** is available that allows you to click through this lab at your own pace. You may find slight differences between the interactive simulation and the hosted lab, but the core concepts and ideas being demonstrated are the same.

## Lab Objectives
  
In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:

+ Task 1: Create a virtual network
+ Task 2: Enable a service endpoint
+ Task 3: Restrict network access for a subnet
+ Task 4: Add additional outbound rules 
+ Task 5: Allow access for RDP connections
+ Task 6: Restrict network access to a resource

## Task 5: Allow access for RDP connections

Create an inbound security rule that allows Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) traffic to the subnet from anywhere. The rule overrides a default security rule that denies all inbound traffic from the internet. Remote desktop connections are allowed to the subnet so that connectivity can be tested in a later step.

1. On ContosoPrivateNSG | Outbound security rules, from left navigation menu, under **Settings**, select **Inbound security rules**.

1. Select **+ Add**.

## Task 10: Confirm access to storage account

1. On the **Virtual Machine** blade, select **ContosoPrivate** VM.

   ![](../media/unit68.png)

1. On **ContosoPrivate | Connect** page, click on **Connect** and from the dropdown click on **Connect** again.
under **Native RDP** click on **Select** and on **Native RDP** box select **Download RDP file**. 

   ![](../media/imgai900.png)
   
1. Open the downloaded rdp file. If prompted, select Connect. Enter the user name **TestUser** and password **Pa55w.rd!!**.

   >**Note:** Ignore the warning and click on **Keep** to open the downloaded RDP file.

1. Select **OK**.

1. You may receive a certificate warning during the sign-in process. If you receive the warning, select **Yes** to proceed with the connection.

1. On the **ContosoPrivate** VM, from the start menu open the **windows powershell**.

   >**Note:** In the pop-up related to network visibility click **No**.

1. On the ContosoPrivate VM, map the Azure file share to drive Z using PowerShell. Before running the commands that follow, replace **[storage-account-key]** that you noted in eariler task.

     ```azurecli
     $acctKey = ConvertTo-SecureString -String "[storage-account-key]" -AsPlainText -Force
     
     $credential = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -ArgumentList "Azure\contosostorage<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>", $acctKey
     
     New-PSDrive -Name Z -PSProvider FileSystem -Root "\\contosostorage<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>.file.core.windows.net\marketing" -Credential $credential
     
     ```

   >**Note**: The Azure file share successfully mapped to the Z drive.

   ![](../media/unit69.png)

1. Confirm that the VM has no outbound connectivity to the internet from a command prompt:

   **ping bing.com**

   ![](../media/unit691.png)
   
   >**Note**: You receive no replies because the network security group associated to the Private subnet does not allow outbound access to the internet.

1. Close the remote desktop session to the ContosoPrivate VM.

## Task 11: Confirm access is denied to storage account

1. Enter **ContosoPublic** in **Search resources, services and docs (G+/)**, box at the top of the portal.

1. When **ContosoPublic** appears in the search results, select it.

   ![](../media/unit692.png)

1. Complete steps 1-7 of previous task to get Confirm access to storage account task for the ContosoPublic VM.  
     
1. â€ŽAfter a short wait, you receive a New-PSDrive : Access is denied error. Access is denied because the ContosoPublic VM is deployed in the Public subnet. The Public subnet does not have a service endpoint enabled for Azure Storage. The storage account only allows network access from the Private subnet, not the Public subnet.

   ![](../media/L7U5-4.png)

1. Confirm that the public VM does have outbound connectivity to the internet from a command prompt:

   **Note**:  Access is denied, because your computer is not in the Private subnet of the CoreServicesVNet virtual network.

   **Warning**: Prior to continuing you should remove all resources used for this lab. To do this On the Azure portal select Resource groups. Select any resources groups you have created. On the resource group blade select Delete Resource group, enter the Resource Group Name and select Delete. Repeat the process for any additional Resource Groups you may have created. Failure to do this may cause issues with other labs.

## Extend your learning with Copilot

Copilot can assist you in learning how to use the Azure scripting tools. Copilot can also assist in areas not covered in the lab or where you need more information. Open an Edge browser and choose Copilot (top right) or navigate to *copilot.microsoft.com*. Take a few minutes to try these prompts.
+ What is the difference between azure service endpoints and private endpoints?
+ Which Azure services can use service endpoints?
+ What are the steps to restricting access to Azure Storage by using service endpoints?

## Learn more with self-paced training

+ [Secure and isolate access to Azure resources by using network security groups and service endpoints](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/modules/secure-and-isolate-with-nsg-and-service-endpoints/). In this module, you learn how to use virtual network service endpoints to control network traffic to and from Azure services.

## Key takeaways
+ Virtual network service endpoints extend your private address space in Azure by providing a direct connection to your Azure services.
+ Service endpoints let you secure your Azure resources to only your virtual network. Service traffic will remain on the Azure backbone, and doesn't go out to the internet.
+ Azure service endpoints are available for many services, such as: Azure Storage, Azure SQL Database, and Azure Cosmos DB.
+ Virtual network service endpoints are not, by default, accessible from on-premises networks. To access resources from an on-premises network, use NAT IPs.

## Review
In this lab, you have completed:

+ Allow access for RDP connections
+ Restrict network access to a resource
+ Create a file share in the storage account
+ Restrict network access to a subnet
+ Create virtual machines
+ Confirm access to storage account
+ Confirm access is denied to storage account

## You have successfully completed the lab.
