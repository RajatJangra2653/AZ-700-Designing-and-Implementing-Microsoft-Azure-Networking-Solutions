# Module 04-Unit 4 Create and configure an Azure load balancer

## Lab scenario 
In this lab, you will create an internal load balancer for the fictional Contoso Ltd organization.

**Note:** An **[interactive lab simulation](https://mslabs.cloudguides.com/guides/AZ-700%20Lab%20Simulation%20-%20Create%20and%20configure%20an%20Azure%20load%20balancer)** is available that allows you to click through this lab at your own pace. You may find slight differences between the interactive simulation and the hosted lab, but the core concepts and ideas being demonstrated are the same.

The steps to create an internal load balancer, are very similar to those you have already learned about in this module, to create a public load balancer. The key difference is that with a public load balancer the front end is accessed via a public IP address, and you test connectivity from a host which is located outside your virtual network; whereas, with an internal load balancer, the front end is a private IP address inside your virtual network, and you test connectivity from a host inside the same network.

 
## Lab Objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:

+ Task 1: Create the virtual network
+ Task 2: Create backend servers
+ Task 3: Create the load balancer
+ Task 4: Create load balancer resources
+ Task 5: Test the load balancer

## Estimated time: 60 minutes

     ![](../media/pwershell4.png)
       
1. Please make sure you have selected your resource group **IntLB-RG-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** then select **Region** **<inject key="Region" enableCopy="false"/>** and enter **blob<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** for the **Storage account name** and enter **blobfileshare<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** for the  **File share** , then click on **Create**.
    
1. On the toolbar of the Cloud Shell pane, select the Select **Manage files** icon, in the drop-down menu, select **Upload** and upload the following files **azuredeploy.json**, **azuredeploy.parameters.vm1.json**, **azuredeploy.parameters.vm2.json** and **azuredeploy.parameters.vm3.json** from **C:\AllFiles\AZ-700-Designing-and-Implementing-Microsoft-Azure-Networking-Solutions-prod\Allfiles\Exercises\M04** folder into the Cloud Shell home directory one by one.

     ![](../media/pwershell2.png)

1. Deploy the following ARM templates to create the VMs needed for this exercise:

   ```powershell
   $RGName = "IntLB-RG-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>"
   
   New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName $RGName -TemplateFile azuredeploy.json -TemplateParameterFile azuredeploy.parameters.vm1.json

## Task 4: Create load balancer resources

In this section, you will configure load balancer settings for a backend address pool, then create a health probe and a load balancer rule.

### Task 4.1: Create a backend pool and add VMs to the backend pool

The backend address pool contains the IP addresses of the virtual NICs connected to the load balancer.

1. On the Azure portal, from top left corner of page click **Show portal menu** and select **All resources**, then select on **myIntLoadBalancer** from the resources list.

    ![](../media/unit4-image5.png)

1. On **myIntLoadBalancer** blade, from the left navigation menu, under **Settings** section, select **Backend pools**, and then select **+ Add**.

1. On the **Add backend pool** page, enter the information from the table below.

   | **Setting**     | **Value**            |
   | --------------- | -------------------- |
   | Name            | **myBackendPool**    |

+ How are the Azure public and private load balancers different? Provide example scenarios for each type.
+ Provide a table that compares the Azure load balancer basic and standard SKUs.
+ How does the Azure load balancer decide to process incoming requests?


## Learn more with self-paced training
+ [Introduction to Azure Load Balancer](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/modules/intro-to-azure-load-balancer/). This module explains what Azure Load Balancer does, how it works, and when you should choose to use Load Balancer as a solution to meet your organization's needs.
+ [Troubleshoot inbound network connectivity for Azure Load Balancer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/troubleshoot-inbound-connectivity-azure-load-balancer/). In this module, you identify and troubleshoot common Azure Load Balancer inbound connectivity issues.

## Key takeaways

Congratulations on completing the lab. Here are the main takeaways for this lab. 
+ Load balancing refers to efficiently distributing incoming network traffic across a group of backend servers or resources.
+ Azure Load Balancer distributes inbound flows from the load balancer's frontend to backend pool instances. These flows are distributed according to configured load-balancing rules and health probes. The backend pool instances can be Azure virtual machines (VMs) or virtual machine scale sets.
+ Azure offers both public and private load balancers. Public Load Balancers are ideal for internet-facing applications, outbound connections, and web applications. Private load balancers are better for internal applications, backend services, and hybrid scenarios.
