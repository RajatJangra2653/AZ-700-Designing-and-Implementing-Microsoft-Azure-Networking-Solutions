# Module 01-Unit 4 Design and implement a Virtual Network in Azure

In this hands-on lab, you will create and configure multiple virtual networks (VNets) and subnets in Azure. You will start by setting up the CoreServicesVnet, followed by the ManufacturingVnet, and finally the ResearchVnet, each with their respective subnets. This lab will guide you through the process of verifying the creation and configuration of these VNets and subnets, enhancing your skills in network architecture and management within Azure.

## Lab scenario 

Now you're ready to deploy virtual networks in the Azure portal.

Consider the fictional organization Contoso Ltd, which is in the process of migrating infrastructure and applications to Azure. In your role as network engineer, you must plan and implement three virtual networks and subnets to support resources in those virtual networks.

**Note:** An **[interactive lab simulation](https://mslabs.cloudguides.com/guides/AZ-700%20Lab%20Simulation%20-%20Design%20and%20implement%20a%20virtual%20network%20in%20Azure)** is available that allows you to click through this lab at your own pace. You may find slight differences between the interactive simulation and the hosted lab, but the core concepts and ideas being demonstrated are the same.


## Lab Objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:

+ Task 1: Create the CoreServicesVnet virtual network and subnets
+ Task 2: Create the ManufacturingVnet virtual network and subnets
+ Task 3: Create the ResearchVnet virtual network and subnets
+ Task 4: Verify the creation of VNets and Subnets

## Learn more with self-paced training
+ [Design an IP addressing schema for your Azure deployment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/design-ip-addressing-for-azure/). In this module, identify the public and private IP addressing capabilities of Azure virtual networks.
+ [Introduction to Azure Virtual Networks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/introduction-to-azure-virtual-networks/). In this module, you learn how to design and implement Azure networking services. You learn about virtual networks, public and private IPs, DNS, virtual network peering, routing, and Azure Virtual NAT.

## Key takeaways
+ Azure Virtual Network is a service that provides the fundamental building block for your private network in Azure. An instance of the service (a virtual network) enables many types of Azure resources to securely communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks. Ensure nonoverlapping address spaces. Make sure your virtual network address space (CIDR block) doesn't overlap with your organization's other network ranges.
+ All Azure resources in a virtual network are deployed into subnets within the virtual network. Subnets enable you to segment the virtual network into one or more subnetworks and allocate a portion of the virtual network's address space to each subnet. Your subnets shouldn't cover the entire address space of the virtual network. Plan ahead and reserve some address space for the future.
